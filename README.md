Let’s start with a compact summary of the project – Desktop Voice Assistant using Python.
You all must have used your mobile phone or computer using voice commands to perform
various activities like Typing using your voice in the keyboard app, searching something on
Google or Youtube, fetching results from Wikipedia using voice commands, talking to
Google Assistant or Siri, etc.
It seems to be so cool that you can talk to your machine like you are talking to a person. It’s
quite interactive. Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own Voice
Assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word,
doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, searching anything on Google or
Youtube and performing usual tasks like opening applications on your Laptop/Desktop.
In this documentation, We will go through the procedures on how you can make your
Personal Desktop Voice Assistant using Python programming language. I have given a
sweet name to the Voice Assistant I have developed. Its name is Sentry!
What can Sentry do for you?
● Want to send an Email to anyone but feeling lazy to type? Don’t worry, Your Voice
Assistant will do it on your behalf. You just have to say what you want to email.
● Want to access some quick information about something that just clicked in your
mind? Don’t worry, Your Voice Assistant will fetch Wikipedia results for you.
● Want to search something on Google or Youtube but not in the mood to type? Don’t
worry, Your Voice Assistant will search it and display the results for you. Just say
what you want to search.
● Not able to remember what date is today? Just ask your Assistant..
● Want to know what the weather is out of your home? Just ask your Assistant..
● Find it a tedious task when opening applications on your computer? Just ask your
Assistant to open applications like Chrome, Code Editor, Microsoft Office Apps, etc.
